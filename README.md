### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a BSc student in food science and technology at University of Copenhagen, Denmark. 

I have a special interest in data science and analytical chemistry (especially rapid methods for large scale production), which is why I'm on Github.

I am currently working on getting familiar with the Github flow and I am also teaching myself MATLAB; all is in preperation for my upcoming bachelor thesis.
