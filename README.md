### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a BSc student in food science and technology at University of Copenhagen, Denmark. 
I have a special interest in data science and analytical chemistry, which is why I'm on Github.

I am currently working on getting familiar with the Github flow and I am also teaching myself MATLAB; all is in preperation for my upcoming bachelor thesis.
